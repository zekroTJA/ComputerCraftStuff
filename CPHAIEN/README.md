# CPHAIEN STORAGE SYSTEM

`CPHAIEN` stands for the quote `coole Protokolle haben aber immer einen Namen` *(german for `cool protocols always have a cool name`)*. So its the name of the communication protocol, which is used for the communication between the clients, server and checker PC's for the control of the storage system.

Just open up one of the source files to find more information on how this simple but really useful protocol works.
